This repository is meant as an accompaniment to [RTNeural](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/RTNeural).
Any code that would otherwise belong in RTNeural, but is
currently deemed to experimental or otherwise not yet ready
to be a part of the main library goes here!

Feel free to use this code as you wish, but be aware that
it may change at any time, and may at some point be moved
to the main repository, or removed entirely.
